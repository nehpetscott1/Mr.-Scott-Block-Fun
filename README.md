- **Adaptive Difficulty** that adjusts based on player performance
- **Educational Analytics** - Tracks detailed metrics for classroom data analysis
- **Multiple Game Modes** - Daily challenges, symbolic boost, and adaptive mode
- **Teacher Dashboard** - Export session data as CSV for analysis
- **Accessibility Options** - Colorblind palette and reduced motion support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Play Immediately (No Setup Required)

1. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click "Start Game" or press Space/Enter
3. Start playing!

### Option 2: Full Experience (With Assets)

For the complete experience with music and dynamic backgrounds:

1. Add audio files to the `audio/` directory (see `audio/README.md` for details)
2. Add background images to the `img/` directory (see `img/README.md` for details)
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## üéÆ How to Play

### Controls

- **Arrow Keys / WASD**: Move and rotate pieces
  - Left/Right (A/D): Move piece horizontally
  - Down (S): Soft drop (move down faster)
  - Up/Space: Rotate piece clockwise
- **Enter**: Hard drop (instantly place piece)
- **C / Shift**: Hold current piece for later
- **P**: Pause game

### Game Options

- **Ghost Piece**: Shows where your piece will land
- **Adaptive Mode**: Automatically adjusts difficulty based on your performance
- **Symbolic Boost**: Rewards accurate play with bonus points
- **Daily Seed**: Play the same random sequence each day
- **Queue Size**: Choose how many upcoming pieces to see (3-5)

### Scoring System

- **Line Clears**:
  - Single: 100 pts √ó level
  - Double: 300 pts √ó level
  - Triple: 500 pts √ó level
  - Tetris (4 lines): 800 pts √ó level
- **T-Spin**: Bonus points for advanced rotation moves
- **Back-to-Back**: 1.5√ó multiplier for consecutive difficult clears
- **Combo**: +50 pts per consecutive line clear
- **Perfect Clear**: +1800 pts for clearing the entire board

## üìä Analytics & Data Export

This game is designed for educational use in data literacy courses. It tracks:

- **Lines Per Minute (LPM)** - Speed metric
- **Input Latency** - Response time measurements
- **Placement Accuracy** - Tracks mis-rotations and corrections
- **Advanced Moves** - T-Spins, Perfect Clears, combos
- **Session Duration** - Time played
- **Difficulty Progression** - Level reached

### For Teachers
