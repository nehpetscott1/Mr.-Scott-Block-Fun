# Background Images

This directory should contain background images that change as you level up in the game.

## Required Images (WebP format recommended)
- `lavender.webp` - Level 1
- `aurora.webp` - Level 3
- `uluru.webp` - Level 5
- `zhangjiajie.webp` - Level 7
- `monument-valley.webp` - Level 9

## Notes
- The game will still function without background images (it will use a plain gradient)
- WebP format is recommended for smaller file sizes, but PNG or JPG will also work
- Images should ideally be landscape-oriented and at least 1920x1080 resolution
- You can find free scenic/nature photos from:

  - Pexels (https://pexels.com/)
